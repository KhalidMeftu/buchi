# Buchi Pet Finder App Coding Challange

Welcome to the pet finder app called Buchi. Using this app, customers can search for pets (cats , dogs , birds etcâ€¦) that have no owners and request to adopt them. 
We currently store our own pet list in our local database. but we also refer to a third party pet finder app called petfinder. So when customers search for pets in our app, the system will search both the local database and petfinder app using their api.
